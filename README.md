# Plex-Export-Docker
A dockerized version of [Dachande663/Plex-Export](https://github.com/Dachande663/Plex-Export) with [dpDesignz/plex-export-responsive-skin](https://github.com/dpDesignz/plex-export-responsive-skin)

Dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/ex0nuss/plex-export-docker

## Summary
This is a dockerized version of [Dachande663/Plex-Export](https://github.com/Dachande663/Plex-Export)

> Plex Export allows you to produce an HTML page with information on the media contained within your Plex library. This page can then be shared publicly without requiring access to the original Plex server.

The container is based on the php:alpine image.
A webserver like **Nginx or Apache is needed** to serve the website (see below for an **example with nginx**). Having PHP and Nginx in the same container could cause an security risk and is against the microservices approach.

## How to use it with Docker-Compose & Nginx

First, pull the image:
```sh 
$ docker pull ex0nuss/plex-export-docker 
```
<br />

Create a nginx config file called `default.conf`:
```sh 
server {
    index index.html;
    server_name localhost;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
    root /data/;
}
```
<br />

Create the `docker-compose.yml`:
```YAML
version: '3'

services:
  plexexport-php:
    image: ex0nuss/plex-export-docker:latest
    container_name: plexexport-php
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./data-plexexport:/data
    environment:
      - PLEX_URL=http://YourPlexIP:32400
      - PLEX_TOKEN=YourPlexToken

  plexexport-nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: plexexport-nginx
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    volumes:
      - ./data-plexexport:/data
      - ./default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    depends_on:
      - plexexport-php
```
